# Status Page

This is the offical repo for the TTNRT status page!

You can find the **issues or pages** created here on GitHub!

## Why?

Well the reason is simple, not really..

I host the files here and host them with GitHub Pages, along with a workflow for reby and mostly hugo for the file on them!

Not really managing these files, but soon maybe..

## Where?

It uses cstate for the program.

Not anything special is in this repo of it anyway.. Best I can do!

## Can I fork?

No. No one can because of memeber perms in this project!
