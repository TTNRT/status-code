We are preparing a upgrade for our proxy server to Debian as our Ubuntu server is currently having issues with it's VNC server. We are trying to get a desktop working for a easier expierence, however that is not the case.


This issue will be updated later today as we backup files and any data. Once we shutdown the server, it will become inposabile to access it. Please understand that this is going to include a install for Mastodon on one of our other server laying around. You keep this in mind however.
