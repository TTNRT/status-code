We have news that Netrocorp will soon be changing their current server, that is responsible for hosting our services and website, will be migrating to a new server.
The reason for this is for more RAM, disk usage, and processing power. This will be pushed no matter what happens. The expected time for the change to happen is on November 16,2023 at 6 AM ET. The expected finish is on November 16, 2023 at 8:30 AM ET.

This change will effect all services, including our Discord Bots that are hosted on the server. We want to usure you that their is no data loss that may occur, however it may change. Please keep close attention to the status site for more updates reguarding the changes to the server. You should expect downtime to all of US East. While this is a very different change, we will be backing up any pontial data that may be lost during the migration to Azure VM's for keeping our data safe.

Thank you for reading this on short notice! We hope you have a great Tuesday!

## Update

The migration was successful! We thank you for your patince during this time. However, there was issues at first during the migration. Our hosting provider says that they reschedule it, but it ended up working. We currently have no information on the new server as of now, but will get more soon. We thank you for waiting!
