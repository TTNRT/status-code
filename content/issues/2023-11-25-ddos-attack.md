Earlyier today, US East has suffered a DDOS attack from the main server, hosted by NetroCorp. We are unsure on the problem at this time. However, to keep user bandwidth from spaming any further, our staff and administrators have made a decision to enable 'Under Attack Mode' withn our cloudflare account that uses our domain.

This is required when a ddos attack happens to any of our locations that host a service where posabile. Until the situition is resolved, the action will be taken.

## Update 1

We have sent the shutdown signal to our container. Please note that other sites are not affected, including our blog, status site, docs, and health site.
