We have word about a posabile freezing rain storm of some sort posabile for the Midwest proxy's location. Under our Data Loss Prevention act, we have decided to take the Midwest proxy server completely offline, along with our TTHost server, to prevent any data loss that may occur.

This may affect some services located on US Midwest, so please keep that in mind for the time being. We expect the storm to affect our area tomorrow at the latest. Please monitor this issue for any updates.
