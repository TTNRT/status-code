We have word about a posabile freezing rain storm of some sort posabile for the Midwest proxy's location. Under our Data Loss Prevention act, we have decided to take the Midwest proxy server completely offline, along with our TTHost server, to prevent any data loss that may occur.

This may affect some services located on US Midwest, so please keep that in mind for the time being. We expect the storm to affect our area tomorrow at the latest. Please monitor this issue for any updates.

2024-01-08 06:38:00 - There seams to be no freezing rain storm for US Midwest. After some discovery from the Weather Prediction Center, they have updated to not include where US Midwest is located. As a result, we have powered on the proxy server, and services are online.
