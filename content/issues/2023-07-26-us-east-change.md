Our Mastodon server will offline from today to Friday July 28th due a internet upgrade where the server is located.

As a result, the server will not be accessable to the public, until the internet upgrade is complete.

The outage will start at around 9PM EDT/8PM CDT/7PM MDT/6PM PDT today, and will be online after tomorrow at around 9AM EDT/8AM CDT/7AM MDT/6AM PDT.

Also, to save bandwidth on whatever is left on our internet, we will be adding in a max client rule to the server to preserve traffic from the gateway to my house hosting the server.

Please keep in mind that I will also be affected by this upgrade, so that means I will have no way of contact to me from Discord to Email.

As this is not a actual outage, it will be listed as a notice, and then upgraded to a down status.

Please monitor for more updates regurding this issue.

## Update

The server will now be placed offline for the fiber upgrade. Yes, this is a bit early, but the network is currently too slow for it to send requests back to back at this time.

Again, it will be offline until Friday after the fiber upgrade.

## Update 2

The server was just put online again for a routine check to the mastodon site after the install of ATT fiber.

Unfortunately, the server has decided to give use 403 and 502 errors regurding the configuration file stored.

We have no way of accesing now, and this means that the server hosting it will be offline until a soluation is found.

We are not sure why it does this, considering it is on a fresh install of Ubuntu as well.

Please note that you will not be able to use the site for the time being as well.

For now, you can keep updated with our blog, which is different to Mastodon.

We hope to fix this soon..
