Our Mastodon server will offline from today to Friday July 28th due a internet upgrade where the server is located.

As a result, the server will not be accessable to the public, until the internet upgrade is complete.

The outage will start at around 9PM EDT/8PM CDT/7PM MDT/6PM PDT today, and will be online after tomorrow at around 9AM EDT/8AM CDT/7AM MDT/6AM PDT.

Also, to save bandwidth on whatever is left on our internet, we will be adding in a max client rule to the server to preserve traffic from the gateway to my house hosting the server.

Please keep in mind that I will also be affected by this upgrade, so that means I will have no way of contact to me from Discord to Email.

As this is not a actual outage, it will be listed as a notice, and then upgraded to a down status.

Please monitor for more updates regurding this issue.

## Update

The server will now be placed offline for the fiber upgrade. Yes, this is a bit early, but the network is currently too slow for it to send requests back to back at this time.

Again, it will be offline until Friday after the fiber upgrade.
