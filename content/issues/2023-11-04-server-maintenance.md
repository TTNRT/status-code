NetroCorp has recently reached out to us reguarding a network outage. This means most of our services will be out, including our Discord Bots. We are expecting them to be back online on Sunday November 5th at 8:00 AM ET. 

The given start for this maintenance is around 1:00 AM ET on Sunday, November 5th. Please note that the container hosting our services will be powered on after this maintenance is over.
