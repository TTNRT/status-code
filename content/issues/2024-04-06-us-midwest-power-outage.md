2024-04-06 09:59:00 - The site experienced a unexpected power outage with nothing reported on it. Internet services are also out for the site as well. We are looking into this issue and will update you on the latest information.

2024-04-06 10:11:00 - We are still investigating on why this outage happened. DTE reports that they are aware on the problem and have sent crews to the location effectively. A restoration time is unknown and has not been posted yet as of now. In fact, we are not alone during this outage, as most of the area is also out. In addition, no serve weather is occurring, which means that this could be a equipment problem to the power lines. We will update you when the latest information is available.

2024-04-06 10:26:00 - Power is still out for the site. However, some good news is announced from DTE. The estimated time for power to be restored is 1:20 PM Eastern Time. Although this outage is very odd and not usual for it to happen, it will be looked into later today to find what is the cause of it. Services will be restored by the time the power comes back on.

2024-04-06 11:42:00 - Power is now restored to the site. Services on US Midwest is now online and ready for use. Thank you for your patience during this time.
