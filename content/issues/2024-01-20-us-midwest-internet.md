We are having problems regarding our internet gateway not connecting to the fiber cable. This seams to be a outage for the area where US Midwest is located. While we did manage to restart the gateway in hopes to see if that fixes, nothing is working at this time. We'll try to look into this issue soon.

## Summary

2024-01-20 13:24:00 - 2 hours have passed and the internet is still not coming back online. Our internet provider website says that services they have are online, even though that our Midwest location is out. There could be a outage overnight, right before midnight or something. Other then that, we have no clue on how it started. We will try to investigate the issue, and make sure to restore service to US Midwest as soon as possible. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

2024-01-22 07:22:00 - 2 days have passed since the internet outage has occurred and nothing had changed. However, a internet service provider technician has been called in to further diagnose the problem. The timing for the technician is from 12 PM to 4 PM today at the latest. Once the issue is identified and confirmed, a update will submitted to this issue. We apologize for inconvenience this caused.
