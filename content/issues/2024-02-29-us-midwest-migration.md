We are planning on doing a quick migration of the current US Midwest server to a different server with smaller specs for our services. In addition to these changes, we are also planning on migrating our Mastodon site to US East due to the storage amount it takes. TTCloud is not affected by this. Please note that Mastodon may take time to work or even work while the migration is in progress. TTPages may be moved as well. The API is not effected. This migration for the server will start 6:30 PM tonight, and the stated services effective for moving to US East will be moved on Friday at the least. You should keep in mind of any outages this may cause during this time.
