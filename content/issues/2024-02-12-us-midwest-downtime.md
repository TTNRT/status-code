We are having an unsual amount of downtime that is affecting the entire network for US Midwest. We are not sure on what is happening, however we belive that this issue is related to other devices surrounding the network. This should not affect the site in any other way. Our speed started to slow down last night, and we belived we think that might be the case. Other than that, we have no clue on how this occured. We will look into this problem later.
