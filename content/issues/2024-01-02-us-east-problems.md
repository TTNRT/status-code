We are having problems with our US East server, as both services hosted on it are slowing down for an unknown cause. We are trying to gather more information on what is going on. Right now, all websites hosted on US East are giving time out errors or other related error codes. We will look into this situation more later today.

## Summary
2024-01-02 12:32 PM: US East is now back online, and all services are restored to service. We still don't know on what caused it to go offline, however more information will be looked into for the time being.
