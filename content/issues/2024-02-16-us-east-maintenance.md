We have word reguarding a routine maintenance on US East. From what we got, this maintenance will take place on the 18th of February at around 12 AM Eastern Time and then end at 1 AM Eastern Time. This will effect all services on US East, including our website and TTGit. To make the maintenance successful, our container hosting our services on site will be shutdown to ensure everything goes well. You may expect some downtime to the site. No action is required at the moment. Please wait while we gather more information.

## Summary
2024-02-18 12:57:00 - Seams like the maintenance went well as expected. No issues were reported during the upgrades that were planned for it. Some small issues were encountered but we will look into that later on. Either way, services on US East are fully restored. Any comments or concerns should be forwarded to this email, if any: shoffer@ttnrtsite.me
