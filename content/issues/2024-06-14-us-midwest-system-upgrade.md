Description: 

We are upgrading our US Midwest site for a operating system and storage operation. All services on site will be offline for some time until the operation is completed.

\---

\[June 13, 2024 10:00 PM] Offline - We have sent the shutdown command to the site. The operation begins now. 

\[June 13, 2024 10:44 PM] Idle - The system has been installed. However, our site will remain offline until tomorrow. We will get back to this as soon as we can. 

\[June 14, 2024 9:15 AM] Idle - We have started the restoration of our US Midwest site, both with gathering our required packages and all. In addition to this, we have decided to separate some of our services to our other machines. This should help out with any resources that can build up. The proxy server will still be our 2GB server, while the 8GB server will the host the other websites. 

\[June 14, 2024 10:32 AM] Online - As of now, our Midwest site is coming back online. However, services that were located on the 2GB server are not yet installed on the 8GB server. This issue will be closed once all services are forwarded and working.

\[June 14, 2024 12:00 PM] Success - This issue is now closed. All services are operational
