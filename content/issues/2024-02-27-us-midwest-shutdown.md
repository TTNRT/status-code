We are having strong winds where US Midwest is located. Considering the weather that is forecasted for tomorrow and the threats that are possible, we have decided the shut down the site until the weather passes or when the weather calms down below severe levels. The system that is pushing to the site may cause power outages. Other discussions will be made throughout the day and tomorrow to determine when we should allow access to US Midwest. Please monitor this issue for updates.

## Summary
2024-02-27 3:36 PM - We sent the power off signal to the site. Services on site are now offline.
