We are having strong winds where US Midwest is located. Considering the weather that is forecasted for tomorrow and the threats that are posabile, we have decided the shut down the site until the weather passess or when the weather calms down below severe levels. The system that is pushing to the site may cause power outages. Other disscusions will be made throughout the day and tomorrow to determine when we should allow access to US Midwest. Please montior this issue for updates.
