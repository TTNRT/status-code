We are having extreme snow fall where US Midwest site is located in Michigan. Due to the snow that is occuring at this time, a short power cut was active, causing a power outage to the cathy server. For that, we are unsure on if our server will be online again.
However, our gateway is having problems with the fiber cable, and is preventing anything to come out. For these reasons, we are taking action to shutdown the cathy server to prevent these issues to happen again. Also, due to the amount of snow that is falling, we might have to wait till another day to restore service to this site.
We will try to get things back to normal as soon as possible. We do apologize for this outage to occur on days like this.
