We are having extreme snow fall where US Midwest site is located in Michigan. Due to the snow that is occuring at this time, a short power cut was active, causing a power outage to the cathy server. For that, we are unsure on if our server will be online again.
However, our gateway is having problems with the fiber cable, and is preventing anything to come out. For these reasons, we are taking action to shutdown the cathy server to prevent these issues to happen again. Also, due to the amount of snow that is falling, we might have to wait till another day to restore service to this site.
We will try to get things back to normal as soon as possible. We do apologize for this outage to occur on days like this.

## Summary
2024-01-13 11:52:00 - The snow is starting to weaken as of now. However, some good news is now released. The heavy snow fall will mostly end around 2:30 PM today. Although the outage to the Midwest server was unexpected, we are still planning on powering on the server on a latest time. For this, we will power on the server 10 minutes after 2:30 PM, due to other possible outages that may occur. We thank you for your patience during this outage.

2024-01-13 13:17:00 - We have decided to bring the server back online a bit early, as the weather conditions are starting to weaken a bit. Services are restored and the incident is resolved
